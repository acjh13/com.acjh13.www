Most of the entries here come from my time at DigiPen with a couple that I tackled myself. I've worn many hats in my time at DigiPen Singapore, usually always at a Producer/Project Manager role, where I'm able to oversee the entire project at once.  

I've worked with Unreal Engine 4, Unity, Godot as well as custom C++ engines created as part of student projects.  

My latest project was working with a team of 11 in a custom C++ engine creating a 3D game.
