I've worn many hats in my time at DigiPen Singapore, usually always at a Producer/Project Manager role, where I'm able to oversee an entire project at once.  

This page lists all notable projects I've worked on, ranging from multi-disciplined student games to solo game jams. I've worked with Unreal Engine 4, Unity, Godot as well as custom C++ engines created as part of student projects.
